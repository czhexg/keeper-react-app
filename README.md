I learned the MERN stack by following Dr Angela Yu's Udemy course "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). In the React chapter, she taught how to make the main keeper page using node.

After completeing the chapter, I decided to apply what I have learned in the previous chapters and integrate MongoDB + Mongoose and Express server. I built a backend api using Express and also connected it to MongoDB which allowed me to store the notes. I also added authentication using sessions and cookies, where users can register and login to their account to access their notes.
